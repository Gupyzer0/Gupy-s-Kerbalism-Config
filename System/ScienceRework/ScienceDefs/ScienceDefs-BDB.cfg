// 	default = What do you mean the settings are all wrong? Aperture shmaperture, this is science!
// 	default = This would be a perfect addition to the KSC photo album!

// 	SunInSpaceHigh = She is very bright and very beautiful. Kerbol, the star that keeps Kerbalkind alive...
// 	SunInSpaceLow = The light coming off Kerbol has made the image pure white! You're lucky you didn't damage the camera...

// 	KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The administrators grumble about it and most of them aren't smiling but you manage to get a group photo of everyone except Stan whose head you cut off in the frame.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The astronauts being who they are begin fighting to see who is going to be in the center of the group photo.  Unsurprisingly, Jeb won.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The crawlerway is a long slab of concrete but your photo might one day make it into an abstract art gallery.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = It's a damned flag pole.  And there's not flag flying today.  So you took a picture of a long metal stick.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The details around the launch pad will be very popular with people playing the latest computer game - Human Space Program - a very popular game about a fictional race of creatures who go into space.

// 	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = For just a moment, you thought you saw peering out of the window what appeared to be a tall, vaguely kerbal shaped figure with pinkish-brown skin, a roudn head and nearly 4 times the height of a normal kerbal.  It was disturbing and unfortunately the photo you took was blurred.  No one will believe you.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = It's a large tank filled with something that you are unable to identify and the researchers refuse to tell you what it is.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The photos of the latest wind tunnel test of the new launch vehicle were confiscated by Arnold the Giant Kerbal again.

// 	KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The photos of landing aircraft you took have turned out extremely well and appeared in Kane's Defense Weekly.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedSPH = Several pictures of the latest generation of space planes have made their way into the public and you're being blamed for it.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You should go back to the runway for more pictures of aircraft.  The photos of large concrete buildings just aren't as interesting.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = It's a tank full of jet fuel.  At least the pilots say that it is but secretly you believe this to be the storage vat for Jeb's supply of beer.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = If Jeb's beer isn't in the round tank, it has to be here.  Unfortunately, if you're wrong when you open the tank it will likely mean your death.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = On the hunt for Jeb's beer storage tank you have taken photos of the water tower.  Unfortunately Arnold the Giant Kerbal told you to come down halfway in your climb to the top to prove your theory.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = As you start taking photos of the large comm dishes in the area, you see a black government car pull up but no one gets out.  They're just sitting there.  Watching you.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = The black government car pulls around the corner as you make your way to the east dish.  Maybe your camera is making them nervous.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = Four kerbals wearing black suits and ties with dark sunglasses have all gotten out of the car.  One of them is talking to his wrist for some reason while looking directly at you taking your photographs.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = As you hurry around the corner to the south dish you run head on into Arnold followed by one of the government suits.  There's a blinding flash of light and when you wake up no one is there, you can't remember anything and your camera is empty of all photos.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You were able to snap a shot of the hub but at the distance you took the picture it looks like nothing more than a mobile home with three large satellite dishes in the front yard.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The VAB is so tall you had to lay on the ground to fit it in the frame.  You've won a $50 prize for an abstract photo contest with this image.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = After winning your $50 photo contest with your other VAB shot you decided to try the same thing again.  Unfortunately this is old hat now and everyone is taking pictures by lying on the ground now.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The memorial is a somber reminder of all the brave souls who came before and gave their lives in service to the greater good.  That's what the researchers and engineers who blew them up say anyway.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The hunt for Jeb's beer storage continues...
// 	KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = The engineers chose this location for their group photo.  It was lovely and all 219 asked you to make a copy of it for them.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The ground crew chose this location for their ground photo.  You are nearly positive they were using this as a pretense to protect Jeb's beer storage.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It really was much easier to fit the entire KSC in an image from the air.  Climbing to the top of the VAB just didn't cut it but you still got a resonably good shot of the grounds.

// 	KerbinSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before?
// 	KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Large rolling fields of long grass with very few trees create a pastoral image you couldn't pass up.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The frozen tundra presents a stark view that is both nearly lifeless on a large scale but serenely beautiful.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The mountain vistas or Kerbin are beautiful to behold and make for some of the best photos you have ever taken.

// 	KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Glaciers, vast ice fields and chasms create a varied landscape which is captured wonderfully in your photos.  Your nose is also frost bitten now.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedShores = The photos of the shores you have taken have recently been licensed by a travel company to create brochures to bring tourists to the beach.
// 	KerbinSrfLandedWater = While the ocean is beautiful and terrible to behold at times, today it is nearly smooth as glass and you capture reflected sunlight from the surface of the water at sunset creating a lovely image.
// 	KerbinSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before?
// 			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The grasslands make up most of Kerbin’s surface, and where most Kerbals live. The surface is covered by farms and the occasional city.

// 	MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = A favorite landing site of many, photographic evidence helps to reveal this crater to be one of the oldest on the surface.
// 	MunSrfLandedHighland = The highland regions of the Mun appear to have been formed during a period where the surface of the Mun was still geologically active.
// 	MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These small impact craters are younger and therefore photographic data helps to answer many questions about the different impact eras of the Mun.
// 	MunSrfLandedMidlands = As with other regions on the Mun, imaging data shows the midlands appear to have been thrust upward during a geologically active period on the Mun.
// 	MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As with other smaller impact regions, the midland craters are shown through photo evidence to be younger than other impact areas around the Mun.
// 	MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = This gigantic basin appears to be the result of molten rock flowing over the surface in the distant past.  Imaging data from the surface does not help to answer what may have caused it to flow in the first place.
// 	MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = This enormous impact region was formed during the earliest days of the Mun's formation which imaging data will help understand.
// 	MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = This high latitude impact region was formed around the same time as the Northwest Crater making it among the oldest areas of the Mun.  Photographic data from this region helps to reveal details of this impact and its aftermath.
// 	MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The polar lowlands appear to be a region formed during a geologically active period and was affected by the mammoth impact events occuring during that time.  Photographic evidence of this region helps to reveal how these processes interacted.

// 			MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = You wonder how big of an asteroid is needed to make craters this wide, before realizing there are far larger craters on the Mun.
// 			MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands are lighter in appearence,
// 			MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = Some of these craters look to be far older than the ones in the Mun’s midlands

// 			MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The basin was likely formed by volcanic activity.
// 			MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = One of the most prominent landmarks on the Mun when viewed from the surface of Kerbin, Kerbals have spent millennia guessing what might have created it.
// 			MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = Just another impact crater, located in the northwest.
// 			MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = Just another impact crater, located in the southwest.
// 			MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = You reflect on how you’re the first kerbal to see this part of the Mun.
// 			MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = Despite their similarity, these craters may have been created millions of years apart
// 			MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = The crater is nicely framed by Kerbin rising over the horizon.
// 			MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = Unlike the rest of the Mun’s craters, this one is far from the equator.
// 			MunInSpaceLowPoles = Not much different from the rest of the mun, except that some parts of the polar region receive sunlight almost year round
// 			MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Lower areas near the poles might contain water ice where craters are kept in eternal darkness. Or not. Its not like you can see anything in them.
// 			MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. Even the plains are unforgiven, which makes you infer that time has taken its toll on the Mun's surface...
// 				MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears to be very cratered while the lowlands sit pristinely below all of the mountains.

// 	MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = In pictures, the gently rolling lowlands almost appear to be the surface of roiling sea of melted mint ice cream.

// 	MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The highly irregular slopes of Minmus have often been observed in photos as appearing to be "scoops of ice cream" on the surface.
// 	MinmusSrfLandedFlats = It's flat, punctuated by a sharp increase in altitude around the perimeter.  Images help to show just how nearly perfectly level this region really is.
// 	MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = One of the largest flatland regions on the surface, in pictures the great flats appear to be a perfectly smooth frozen lake of green liquid.
// 	MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The largest continuous flat region on the surface, the Greater Flats may once have been a sea of liquid on the surface that has long since frozen.  Images from this region reveal just how large it is as certain areas actually go to the horizon with no change in appearance.
// 	MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = These smaller flat regions appear regularly around the moon and likely were small lakes at some point.  Photos taken in this region are surrounded on all sides by large hills forming the slopes and higher regions of Minmus.
// 	MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the poles is helping to answer questions whether Minmus was once a comet that was captured by Kerbin or whether some alien race simply spilled their giant bowl of mint ice cream.  Researchers are inclined to believe the former but the general public is another question...
// 	MinmusSrfLanded = The minty colored surface amazes you as you stare above and below where you have taken this photo.
// 		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther.
// 				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream...

// 	MohoSrfLandedHighlands = Surface photos in the highlands reveal Moho had to have been volcanically active at some point in the past.  Lava fields and other geologic formations of this region could only have been formed by such activity.
// 	MohoSrfLandedMidlands = Photos taken within the midland region lend further support to the idea that much of Moho's surface has been shaped by volcanism.
// 	MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = These various small craters are numerous on the surface of Moho and photos within them are helping to answer some of the questions about it's geologically active periods.
// 	MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = Unlike it's polar opposite, the north pole of Moho is extremely irregular and cratered with vastly different high and low points.  Photographic evidence clearly shows the highly varied surface.
// 	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = At one time, stories were rampant that an enormous hole existed in this region which penetrated deep into the planet.  Photographic evidence has shown this not to be true.  The public outcry of a government cover-up has reached epic proportions.
// 	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = A long, narrow ridge spanning a good deal of this sinkhole region shows up starkly in photographs.  It is believed to be the product of volcanism but more study will be needed.
// 	MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The lowland regions of the planet are home to numerous small craters and dune like rock formations shown repeatedly in pictures of these regions.
// 	MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands = Similar to the other lowland regions of the planet, evidence of volcanism and repeated impacts show up regularly in image data.
// 	MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands = The lowland regions in the west, just like the other lowland areas of the planet are home to clear geologic formations created by volcanism and photo evidence will help to fill in gaps in our knowledge of this world.

// 	MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The deep canyons and sharp walls are further evidence of geologic activity on the planet as no liquid could have eroded this region.  Photo evidence helps to support the idea this region was created through volcanic activity.
// 	MohoSrfLandedSouthPole = The south pole of Moho is similar in appearance and formation as the various lowlands.  Nearly uniform in altitude with very few craters or differences in high and low points, image data reveals this to be as different from the north pole in appearance as it is in location.
// 	MohoSrfLanded = After your descent, you see the distinct features of the planet. Craters are visible as far as the eye can see.
// 		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort...
// 			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol...

// 	EveSrfLanded = The purple sand of this dense planet stretches across the surface. You get hungry and wonder if this sand is toxic if eaten...
// 	EveSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the surface shows just how uniform and regular the poles of Eve really are.  Slight variations in altitude are revealed but very little in the way of extensive surface features exist to break up the nearly flat regions.
// 	EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = A vast, low lying sea of liquid hydrocarbons shows vividly purple in image data.  It is quite obvious that the coloration caused by the hydrocarbons in both the sea and atmosphere lends Eve its distinct appearance.
// 	EveSrfLandedLowlands = Very low altitudes and gentle, rolling landscapes make up most of the lowlands creating a very purple picturesque image.
// 	EveSrfLandedMidlands = Similar to the lowlands, the midlands differ primarily in their altitude.  The same rolling landscape with very little in the way of features is captured clearly in image data.
// 	EveSrfLandedHighlands = While areas leading to the peaks have broken and irregular landscapes, most of the highlands are revealed in photographs to be extremely similar to the other land regions of the planet.
// 	EveSrfLandedPeaks = An amazing feature of Eve is the sharp, distinct peaks jutting thousands of meters above the surface with sheer cliffs and canyons nestled between them.  The image data from this area has proven to be the public's favorite for it's vistas and distinct appearance.
// 	EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The narrow bands of impact ejecta are proving fascinating to scientists as they struggle to understand the image data which appears to show numerous regions around the planet where bodies have survived the atmosphere to impact the surface.
// 		EveFlyingLow = With numerous low areas and vast, unbroken regions, image data collected in flight is proving most valuable to scientists.
// 			EveFlyingHigh = With the few surface details obliterated due to altitude, photographic data from high altitudes is mostly useful to help refine mapping data for the planet.

// 					EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...



// 	GillySrfLanded = The photo shows a wide variety of mountains. There is really nothing else here.
// 	GillySrfLandedLowlands = The highly irregular surface of this captured asteroid shows up distinctly in image data.  Even the lowlands aren't exactly low in most places and finding level ground is nearly impossible even when looking over photographs.
// 	GillySrfLandedMidlands = The midlands, like the other regions of this barren rock, is as irregular as it is odd looking.  The beige color of the surface shows up in sharp cut relief against the walls of valleys and mountains.
// 	GillySrfLandedHighlands = The highland regions are more erratic in shape, altitude and slope than any other region of this small body causing long shadows and prominent peaks to be cast in stark relief of the image data.
// 		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation.
// 			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

// 	DunaSrfLanded = The red dirt below you appears to be coarse and dry. Wait, did that rock move between photos?
// 	DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Photographs show the rolling hills of the Duna highlands and the irregular surface indicating the presence of geologic activity in the far distant past.
// 	DunaSrfLandedCraters = Impact craters on the surface of Duna are easily seen in imaging data due to the very low levels of erosion on the surface.
// 	DunaSrfLandedPoles = The ice covered poles of Duna shine brightly in pictures and details of the broken glacier fields become readily apparent.
// 	DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The lowlands, like many other areas on Duna, are varied in altitude and surface features.  Imaging data reveals the long term presence of liquid on the surface contributed to erosion in combination with geologic activity on the surface.
// 	DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The midlands lack a defining boundary between regions making it difficult to determine where the highlands end, the midlands begin and the lowland take over.  Further evidence within the imaging data of past geological activity will leave researchers in a tizzy for several years you're sure.
// 		DunaFlyingLow = Surface details showing erosion, weather activity and long term geologic activity is easily seen in photographs from low altitude.
// 			DunaFlyingHigh = The details of the surface have faded but large scale features revealing long term changes to the surface is unmistakable in photos from high altitude.

// 					DunaInSpaceHigh = The pale orange dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...

// 	IkeSrfLanded = The pictures show rocky evidence of recent tectonic activity.
// 	IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The polar lowlands are one of the few fairly level regions of Ike's surface.  It is unknown whether this is formerly an impact crater or simply a surface feature and photos do not help to determine the answer to this nagging question.
// 	IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Like the majority of the Ike, the midlands are a broken landscape marked by vastly different altitudes, steep slopes and cliffs and a distinct lack of craters all of which is revealed in imaging data.
// 	IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The lowlands of Ike are deep depressions in the surface at much lower altitudes than most of the moon.  Imaging data shows the transition regions of these areas to be extremely steep and rising quickly to mountain ridges and the higher altitudes of the midlands.
// 	IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The tallest peak on the surface can be found along the Eastern Mountain Ridge and proves to be one of the best places to take wife field images of the surface.
// 	IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The Western Mountain Ridge, although lower in over all altitude, spans almost the entire surface of Ike from pole to pole and it's many plateuas would be very picturesque if it you could actually see anything.  Unfortunately, this region faces away from Duna at all times leaving it largely in darkness due to the low levels of sunlight.
// 	IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The Central Mountain Range, on average, is even lower in altitude than the western ridge but it faces Duna at all times.  This creates opporunities for stunning views across the surface of Ike and out into space towards Duna which you take advantage of with your camera.
// 	IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Like the Western Mountain Ridge, the Easter Range is located on the side of Ike facing away from Duna leaving it in shadowy darkness most of the time.  Your images do littel to illuminate this area.
// 	IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The South Pole of Ike is a colossal plateau towering over 9000m in most places.  It also has a fairly level average surface slope making it an excellent place for landing and research.  However, due to Ike's axial tilt, it faces away from Duna and mostly lies in shadow except in the most westerly areas of the region making your image data difficult to interpret.
// 		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.
// 			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

// 	DresSrfLanded = The surface is barren with intermittent hills surrounding you. The flat areas you once saw, are not as flat as you thought.
// 	DresSrfLandedPoles = The surface of Dres is well known for it's lack of cratering and the poles are no exception.  Photo evidence confirms this.
// 	DresSrfLandedHighlands = The highlands of Dres are not exactly high in comparison to similar regions of the solar system so named.  They are small in area and are largely devoid of craters in photos.  Odd considering they are technically supposed to be the tallest and most exposed regions of the planet.
// 	DresSrfLandedMidlands = Image data shows the midland regions of Dres to be an irregular, broken landscape showing no regular boundaries between regions and frequent changes in altitude.
// 	DresSrfLandedLowlands = The lowland regions of Dres are vast and photo evidence shows that a majority of the few impact craters on the surface occur in these areas.

// 	DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The impact regions of Dres are surrounded by tiny regions of ejecta blankets where debris from the collision spreds out from the impact site.  Photo evidence clearly shows how small these locales really are.
// 	DresSrfLandedImpactCraters = Like other bodies lacking an atmosphere, Dres has impact craters although very few of them in comparion.  Your image data of suspected impact zones may help to identify others.
// 	DresSrfLandedCanyons = The canyons of Dres have some of the steepest and tallest walls you have seen yet.  Photos of the region are difficult to analyze because these zones are in nearly constant shadow from the cliff sides.
// 		DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid.
// 			DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue.

// 	JoolFlyingLow = Jool looks to be nothing more than a hot, toxic soup. I better get out of here!
// 		JoolFlyingHigh = Jool looks green and cuddly, a worthwhile scientific addition for all Kerbals

// 					LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble.


// 	VallSrfLanded = There are no even landing spots on this moon. Perhaps it is a consequence of cryo-volcanism or the tidal forces exerted on Vall.
// 	VallSrfLandedPoles = The poles look less hostile than some other parts of Vall. Still not a pole you would want to meet in an alley.
// 	VallSrfLandedMidlands = The camera is taking a moment to enjoy the view
// 	VallSrfLandedlowlands = You feel the surface can break at any momentt
// 	VallSrfLandedHighlands = Some massive tidal forces have pushed these mountains high up in the sky.
// 			VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way.
// 				VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot.

// 	TyloSrfLanded = Tylo holds a very dusty surface. The craters seen from above appear to be just another surface feature now.
// 	TyloSrfLandedMajorCrater = It looks like the Kraken has put a wet glass here.
// 	TyloSrfLandedMajorCrater = It looks a bit like a big soup bowl.
// 	TyloSrfLandedMajorCrater = The crater is deep and cold... Pretty much like all craters.
// 	TyloSrfLandedMinorCraters = You know what they say: Even the smallest crater can become a big crater at some point.
// 	TyloSrfLandedHighlands = The view is spectacular. We should build a camp site here.
// 	TyloSrfLandedMidlands = The light is playing tricks with the hills and valleys, causing a dramatic scene.
// 	TyloSrfLandedLowlands = Dusty and dark, somehow this reminds you to clean up the attic this weekend.
// 	TyloSrfLandedMara = Sliding up and down the edge of the crater could be fun.
// 		TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.
// 			TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot?


// 	BopSrfLanded = Bop gives off a peculiar vibe. It is very dark and desolate. Was it once a comet?
// 	BopSrfLandedPoles = From here, Bop looks to be a massive carbon deposit.
// 	BopSrfLandedSlopes = Somebody has spilled coffee over the photo. Rendering it illegible.
// 	BopSrfLandedMara = A long time ago, this planet was visited by a massive asteroid
// 	BopSrfLandedRidges = The surface of this place seems to be a different kind of soil than elsewhere on Bop, which implies that Bop was an acive planet in the past... or someone just dumping dirt over here.
// 	BopSrfLandedValley = The brownish brown over here looks the same brown as the brownish brown over there.
// 	BopSrfLandedPeaks = The view is definitely a dark one.
// 		BopInSpaceLow = Bop appears to reveal a crater with a white rim, which perhaps, could be evidence of a young captured Bop in a young Joolian system.
// 			BopInSpaceHigh = Bop seems to be a brown captured asteroid not unlike Gilly. Perhaps they are related?

// 	PolSrfLanded = Apparently, you landed. The yellow and khaki colored surface seems nice. Oh wait, are you sliding down the cliff??
// 	PolSrfLandedPoles = On Pol, the poles are quite dissimilar from the rest of the body.
// 	PolSrfLandedLowlands = From here, Pol looks to be made from cookie dough!
// 	PolSrfLandedMidlands = From up close, it looks like the geological activity on Pol ended a long time ago.
// 	PolSrfLandedHighlands = The mountains and valleys swirling endlessly remind you of home
// 		PolInSpaceLow = Pol seems unforgiving. Like her sister Bop, she seems to be a captured asteroid. The rough, jagged, and derranged terrain make you think twice about landing.
// 			PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, the speck across the way, reminds you of a pollen grain.


// 	EelooSrfLanded = Eeloo appears to show evidence of a once thin atmosphere. Possibly there are hidden cryo-volcanos that spray gases into the vaccum, intermittently causing a temporary atmosphere.
// 	EelooSrfLandedPoles = Without the heat of Kerbol, the ice deposits up here must be at least a couple millions of years old!
// 	EelooSrfLandedGlaciers = Landing on a moving sheet of ice... What could go wrong?
// 	EelooSrfLandedMidlands = Yup, still icey
// 	EelooSrfLandedLowlands = Serving as a large basin for melting water, this has the freshest looking snow you've seen in... well, ever.

// 	VenusSrfLanded = The dark sands of this dense planet stretches across the surface. You get hungry and wonder if this sand is toxic if eaten...
// 	VenusSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the surface shows just how uniform and regular the poles of Venus really are.  Slight variations in altitude are revealed but very little in the way of extensive surface features exist to break up the nearly flat regions.
// 	VenusSrfLandedLowlands = Very low altitudes and gentle, rolling landscapes make up most of the lowlands creating a very picturesque image.
// 	VenusSrfLandedMidlands = Similar to the lowlands, the midlands differ primarily in their altitude.  The same rolling landscape with very little in the way of features is captured clearly in image data.

// 	VenusSrfLandedPeaks = An amazing feature of Venus is the sharp, distinct peaks jutting thousands of meters above the surface with sheer cliffs and canyons nestled between them.  The image data from this area has proven to be the public's favorite for it's vistas and distinct appearance.
// 	//VenusSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The narrow bands of impact ejecta are proving fascinating to scientists as they struggle to understand the image data which appears to show numerous regions around the planet where bodies have survived the atmosphere to impact the surface.
// 		VenusFlyingLow = With numerous low areas and vast, unbroken regions, image data collected in flight is proving most valuable to scientists.
// 			VenusFlyingHigh = With the few surface details obliterated due to altitude, photographic data from high altitudes is mostly useful to help refine mapping data for the planet.
// 				VenusInSpaceLow = Venus greets you with great delight as you swoop past, with how bright and reflective its clouds are. Too bad you can't see very well beyond them with this camera.
// 					VenusInSpaceHigh = The Morning Star shimmers down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...
	
// 	EarthSrfLandedAdministration = The administrators grumble about it and most of them aren't smiling but you manage to get a group photo of everyone except Stan whose head you cut off in the frame.
// 	EarthSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The astronauts being who they are begin fighting to see who is going to be in the center of the group photo.  Unsurprisingly, Jeb won.
// 	EarthSrfLandedCrawlerway = The crawlerway is a long slab of concrete but your photo might one day make it into an abstract art gallery.
// 	EarthSrfLandedFlagPole = It's a damned flag pole.  And there's not flag flying today.  So you took a picture of a long metal stick.

// 	EarthSrfLandedR&DObservatory = When you asked if you could attach your camera to the telescope to take some pictures they just looked at you funny.  You did get a good picture of the telescope itself though.
// 	EarthSrfLandedR&DSideLab = Look, another concrete building.  You can tell your grandkids one day some amazing story about something that didn't happen to you at this building.
// 	EarthSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = For just a moment, you thought you saw peering out of the window what appeared to be a tall, vaguely kerbal shaped figure with pinkish-brown skin, a roudn head and nearly 4 times the height of a normal kerbal.  It was disturbing and unfortunately the photo you took was blurred.  No one will believe you.
// 	EarthSrfLandedR&DTanks = It's a large tank filled with something that you are unable to identify and the researchers refuse to tell you what it is.
// 	EarthSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The photos of the latest wind tunnel test of the new launch vehicle were confiscated by Arnold the Giant Kerbal again.  Newspapers are reporting a resounding success but you know better.  You just don't have evidence to prove it anymore.  The kerballed test is going forward.
// 	EarthSrfLandedRunway = The photos of landing aircraft you took have turned out extremely well and appeared in Kane's Defense Weekly.
// 	EarthSrfLandedSPH = Several pictures of the latest generation of space planes have made their way into the public and you're being blamed for it.
// 	EarthSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You should go back to the runway for more pictures of aircraft.  The photos of large concrete buildings just aren't as interesting.
// 	EarthSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = It's a tank full of jet fuel.  At least the pilots say that it is but secretly you believe this to be the storage vat for Jeb's supply of beer.
// 	EarthSrfLandedSPHTanks = If Jeb's beer isn't in the round tank, it has to be here.  Unfortunately, if you're wrong when you open the tank it will likely mean your death.
// 	EarthSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = On the hunt for Jeb's beer storage tank you have taken photos of the water tower.  Unfortunately Arnold the Giant Kerbal told you to come down halfway in your climb to the top to prove your theory.
// 	EarthSrfLandedTrackingStation = As you start taking photos of the large comm dishes in the area, you see a black government car pull up but no one gets out.  They're just sitting there.  Watching you.
// 	EarthSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = The black government car pulls around the corner as you make your way to the east dish.  Maybe your camera is making them nervous.
// 	EarthSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = Four kerbals wearing black suits and ties with dark sunglasses have all gotten out of the car.  One of them is talking to his wrist for some reason while looking directly at you taking your photographs.
// 	EarthSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = As you hurry around the corner to the south dish you run head on into Arnold followed by one of the government suits.  There's a blinding flash of light and when you wake up no one is there, you can't remember anything and your camera is empty of all photos.
// 	EarthSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You were able to snap a shot of the hub but at the distance you took the picture it looks like nothing more than a mobile home with three large satellite dishes in the front yard.
// 	EarthSrfLandedVAB = The VAB is so tall you had to lay on the ground to fit it in the frame.  You've won a $50 prize for an abstract photo contest with this image.
// 	EarthSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = After winning your $50 photo contest with your other VAB shot you decided to try the same thing again.  Unfortunately this is old hat now and everyone is taking pictures by lying on the ground now.
// 	EarthSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The memorial is a somber reminder of all the brave souls who came before and gave their lives in service to the greater good.  That's what the researchers and engineers who blew them up say anyway.
// 	EarthSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The hunt for Jeb's beer storage continues...
// 	EarthSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = The engineers chose this location for their group photo.  It was lovely and all 219 asked you to make a copy of it for them.
// 	EarthSrfLandedVABTanks = The ground crew chose this location for their ground photo.  You are nearly positive they were using this as a pretense to protect Jeb's beer storage.
// 	EarthSrfLandedKSC = It really was much easier to fit the entire KSC in an image from the air.  Climbing to the top of the VAB just didn't cut it but you still got a resonably good shot of the grounds.

// 	EarthSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before?
// 	EarthSrfLandedGrasslands = Large rolling fields of long grass with very few trees create a pastoral image you couldn't pass up.

// 	EarthSrfLandedDeserts = The rolling dunes, the vast plains of sand broken only by an occasional oasis and the lighting conditions make you feel like Kansel Kadams.
// 	EarthSrfLandedHighlands = Although the kerbals from this area speak with a brogue accent you can barely understand they have nevertheless guided you to locations within the highlands that allow you to bring out their subtle beauty in your photos.
// 	EarthSrfLandedIceCaps = Glaciers, vast ice fields and chasms create a varied landscape which is captured wonderfully in your photos.  Your nose is also frost bitten now.

// 			EarthInSpaceLowMountains = Snow-capped peaks used to be one of the best destination for adventurous kerbals. At least before the invention of space travel.
// 			EarthInSpaceLowHighlands = The mountains blend into lower terrain with branching ridges. The hills are striped as the valleys cut through different layers of rock.

// 			MoonInSpaceLowNorthPole = Not much different from the rest of the Moon, except that some parts of the polar region receive sunlight almost year round.
// 			MoonInSpaceLowSouthPole = Lower areas near the poles might contain water ice where craters are kept in eternal darkness. Or not. Its not like you can see anything in them.
// 			MoonInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. Even the plains are unforgiven, which makes you infer that time has taken its toll on the Moon's surface...
// 				MoonInSpaceHigh = The Moon appears to be very cratered while the lowlands sit pristinely below all of the mountains.

// 	MercuryInSpace = Scans indicate only a weak induced magnetic field, this is most likely caused by the stream of charged particles in the solar wind flowing around Mercury.
// 	MercurySrfLanded = Low surface level magnetic fields reflect Mercury's lack of any internally generated magnetosphere.
// 	VenusInSpaceLow = A weak induced magnetic field is detected in low orbit around Venus.
// 	VenusInSpaceHigh = Venus' upper atmosphere appears to be exposed to the solar wind, with only a weak induced magnetic field providing some protection.
// 	VenusSrfLanded = Surface level magnetism is slightly lower than that measured in orbit; Venus' strong induced ring current may be responsible for shielding the surface from some of its magnetic field.
// 	MoonInSpaceLow = Localized magnetic fields are detected over several regions of the Moon's surface.
// 	MoonInSpaceHigh = A weak magnetic field indicates that the Moon may once have contained a molten iron core.
// 	MoonSrfLanded = A very faint magnetic field is detected on the Moon's surface.
// 	MarsInSpaceLow = Isolated patches of Mars' atmosphere appear to be protected by small magnetospheres.

// 	IoInSpaceLow = Io appears to generate no magnetic field of its own, implying that its intense geological activity is most likely due to tidal forces, not a molten core.

// 	GanymedeInSpaceHigh = A localized distortion in Jupiter's magnetic field is detected in high orbit of Ganymede.
// 	GanymedeSrfLanded = Strong surface level magnetic fields are detected, indicating an internally generated magnetosphere.

	default = You take a picture of whatever the telescope is pointing at. Do you see anything suspicious?

	SunInSpaceHigh = She is very bright and very beautiful. Kerbol, the star that keeps Kerbalkind alive...
	SunInSpaceLow = The light coming off Kerbol has made the image pure white! You're lucky you didn't damage the camera...

			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The grasslands make up most of Kerbin’s surface, and where most Kerbals live. The surface is covered by farms and the occasional city.
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The water near shores have a lighter shade of blue where it gets shallower. If you could zoom in more you might be able to spot some kerbal a enjoying a day on the beach.
			KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = Snow-capped peaks used to be one of the best destination for adventurous kerbals. At least before the invention of space travel.
			KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The mountains blend into lower terrain with branching ridges. The hills are striped as the valleys cut through different layers of rock.
			KerbinInSpaceLowDesert = The sands look flat compared to the rest of Kerbin’s terrain. There are some strange circles on the surface, which command tells you are farms.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The ocean’s surface is dotted with the wakes of ships traveling across Kerbin’s surface
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The surface looks rocky and difficult to navigate. You confirm the badlands are in fact bad.
			KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You spot some Krussian military bases in the snow. The government agency who gave you your assignment will be pleased.
			KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = Sunlight reflecting off the snow overwhelms the camera.
			KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = Public Outreach tells the public you spotted the Gift Kracken, but you didn’t really.
			KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = There isn’t much here but a flat sheet of ice.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Who knew the space agency would be spying on all these Krussians?

		MunInSpaceLow = The gray, cratered surface in this image can make one philosophical about the uniqueness of their existence.
		MunInSpaceLow = The darker volcanic plains, the mountains, hills, and valleys all remind you of Kerbin. You can see why the astronomers of the Proot Era thought the Mun was another world, with people not unlike our own. //@Proot, creator of the KSP Renaissance Compilation
		MunInSpaceLow = You see some rocks. Or were those rovers? or bases? At this distance, it's hard to tell. But you can tell that they were big. can see anything in them.
		MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. But does this image show any evidence of enemy mun bases?
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlands = The possibly igneous small flats are peppered by small craters and rocks.
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlands = Light-colored ejecta from some craters is visible and not dark igneous rock, so we can now absolutely, definitively prove that even the smallest ones are impact craters.
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlands = There are plenty of rocks here, at least we think those are rocks. At  this distance it's hard to tell if they're natural of artificial, like a rover or something.
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = This area of the midlands has a high concentration of craters big, small, and everything in between. At least we now have a map of them all. 
			    MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands have a slightly lighter appearance, with the frequency of craters-in-craters suggesting that these may contain some of the oldest rock in the Kerbin system. Their overall shape is also reminiscent of the hills and mountains of Kerbin.
			    MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = The large craters, seemingly eroded by aeons of meteorite impacts and solar wind, have plenty of evidence to suggest their old age, and by extension the age of the rest of the highlands.
			    MunInSpaceLowCanyons = These large canyons, probably formed by the force of the same impacts as the large craters they're connected to, are somewhat reminiscent of rovers spilling out into oceans or lakes. No evidence of enemy bases, unfortunately.
			    MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = Observations of details in the visual scan may indicate that this basin was formed by lava welling up after a large asteroid impact.
			    MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = Despite its prominence when viewed from the surface of Kerbin, these relatively close-up observations confirm that this is in fact just a crater, nothing special. Early astronomers thought that this was a dried-up lake.
			    MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = This crater seems eroded, almost like its walls unevenly crumbled after it was formed. Beware of potentially soft rock.
			    MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = Like the East Crater, this is a completely ordinary impact crater. The surface inside is occupied by scattered rocks and smaller craters.
			    MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = Never seen before from Kerbin, this crater looks somewhat younger than the other large craters, the ejecta being faint but still visible.
			    MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = The two craters are remarkably similar despite potentially being millions of years apart in age. The short trench or canyon connecting them likely formed with the younger, larger one.
			    MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = Despite never being seen from above is such detail before, it feels quite familiar. Kerbin looms just over the horizon, sitting there, a reminder of the Mun's tidal lock and the incoming far side, never seen by kerbal eyes before.
			    MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = This is a large crater, the largest on the Mun. Slight glimmers of light in the shadow of the crater rim may signify a deposit of water ice here! Otherwise, you can see rocks. We're sure none of those glimmers were missions on the Mun, neither ours nor the Kerviets'. 
			    MunInSpaceLowPoles = The polar regions. Not bright and shiny as Kerbin's poles,which means that while these are quite boring, our cameras can reveal more detail in them than on Kerbin's poles. Some of the higher areas receive sunlight year-round, but they shadow the polar lowlands where in some places it is permanently dark. The temperature gradient on the surface would be interesting, but this is an optical device. Not an infrared one.
			    MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = The permanently shadowed craters may contain water ice, possibly in high enough concentration to be harvested in the future. Kerbol is permanently on the horizon, and in the lower parts may have never been seen in the history of the Mun. Great hiding place.
			
			MinmusInSpaceLowFlats = The wide flats seem impossibly smooth, even up close. What are they? Craters filled with volcanic material, like the Mun's lowlands? Salt flats formed from lakes once kept warm by the heat of celestial formation? Or mint ice cream, left there for hungry kerbals?
        MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats = The biggest flats on Minmus conjure up images of mint ice cream or shaved ice, with the shiny, icy surface glinting in the sunlight. You close the aperture before the bright light overwhelms the camera.
        MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands and the surrounding midlands are so obviously rock, but what is the sparkly blue-green surface made of? Salt? Copper oxide ore? Blue ice? We'll never know unless we look beyond the visible, which this instrument is unfortunately incapable of doing.
        MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = The flatness of the highland plateaus is remarkable, especially since they aren't at Minmus mean 'sea' level. Maybe these were the original surface of Minmus, before the lower flats formed?
        MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats = These somewhat resemble the ice caps of Kerbin, either that or salt flats. The dessert theory seems to be less credible now, not that it was ever a serious consideration.
        MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats = These look like ice lakes shrouded in the mountains, reminding everyone of such things on Kerbin, and the fact that even this far away, you are still in the (gravitational) influence of home.
        MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes = The slopes are reminiscent of mountainsides on Kerbin, the perfect place to put an observatory. We can't spot any of those, though.
        MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands = The lowlands are like Kerbin's grasslands, with the small hills and gentle slope up to the midlands. They seem like an good spot to set up a long-term base if the flats are proven to be ice sheets over subsurface oceans. Future missions should beware of boulders though.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = You see in detail its large flats, light greenish-blue color and almost sparkly look. Apparent cracks on the surface may land credence to the theory that Minmus is covered in ice, and that the flats are, or were, the surface of internal oceans. The cause of the color is as yet unknown.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther.
				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream...

		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort...
			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol...

				EveInSpaceLow = Eve greets you with great delight as you swoop past, revealing how vast her Explodium Oceans are. You now want a grape popsicle...
					EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...

		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation.
			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

				DunaInSpaceLow = Duna has a vide variety of terrain, ranging from deep chasms, to tall mountain ranges, and plains. Its ice caps are large and dominant of the poles.
					DunaInSpaceHigh = The pale orange dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...

		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

		DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid.
			DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue.

			JoolInSpaceLow = The green hue of Jool dominates the photo with great immensity.
				JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's many moons are seen fantastically before her like a ballet of crumbs around that key lime cake you just devoured.

				LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe has islands, water, and an atmosphere. You wouldn't be suprised if we found microkerbals here...
					LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble.

			VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way.
				VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot?

		BopInSpaceLow = Bop appears to reveal a crater with a white rim, which perhaps, could be evidence of a young captured Bop in a young Joolian system.
			BopInSpaceHigh = Bop seems to be a brown captured asteroid not unlike Gilly. Perhaps they are related?

		PolInSpaceLow = Pol seems unforgiving. Like her sister Bop, she seems to be a captured asteroid. The rough, jagged, and derranged terrain make you think twice about landing.
			PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, the speck across the way, reminds you of a pollen grain.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo shows its true self as you approach, revealing her ice canyons and chasms.
			EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo appears to be very icy. It's spent too long this far away from Kerbol.

		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort...
			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol...

				EveInSpaceLow = Eve greets you with great delight as you swoop past, revealing how vast her Explodium Oceans are. You now want a grape popsicle...
					EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...

		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation.
			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

				DunaInSpaceLow = Duna has a vide variety of terrain, ranging from deep chasms, to tall mountain ranges, and plains. Its ice caps are large and dominant of the poles.
					DunaInSpaceHigh = The pale orange dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...

		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

		DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid.
			DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue.

			JoolInSpaceLow = The green hue of Jool dominates the photo with great immensity.
				JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's many moons are seen fantastically before her like a ballet of crumbs around that key lime cake you just devoured.

				LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe has islands, water, and an atmosphere. You wouldn't be suprised if we found microkerbals here...
					LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble.

			VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way.
				VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot?

		BopInSpaceLow = Bop appears to reveal a crater with a white rim, which perhaps, could be evidence of a young captured Bop in a young Joolian system.
			BopInSpaceHigh = Bop seems to be a brown captured asteroid not unlike Gilly. Perhaps they are related?

		PolInSpaceLow = Pol seems unforgiving. Like her sister Bop, she seems to be a captured asteroid. The rough, jagged, and derranged terrain make you think twice about landing.
			PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, the speck across the way, reminds you of a pollen grain.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo shows its true self as you approach, revealing her ice canyons and chasms.
			EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo appears to be very icy. It's spent too long this far away from Kerbol.
			
			
			
			EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = The grassland plains are the most 'alive' part of Earth. The cities, the lush green grass, the farmland, and the industry. This is home.
			EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = You really can see your house from up here! Oh, there's your annoying neighbor.
			EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = Observed farmland. Crop yields look up to 10 percent higher than last year.
			EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = Mapped some enemy roads. Should be useful if we ever go on an offensive.
			//EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = Observing Kerbograd apartment buildings, doesn't seem to be any different than the ones in Filigrad and Yurigrad. In fact, they look exacty the same.
			//EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = Observed military parade in Kerya. Weapons being developed are a concern, but their current capabilities don't seem to pose any real threat.
			EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = Found some stray kogs around Woomerang. Maybe they can be used as test subjects.
			EarthInSpaceLowGrasslands = This part of the grasslands is exactly that. Grassy. There are some small farms here, seems like their crop was recently harvested.
			EarthInSpaceLowShores = The shallow waters near the coast are teeming with sea life. You can see schools of different fish, some koral, and seaweed.
			EarthInSpaceLowShores = You can see the water from the rivers merge into the sea. You can see the cloudy dark blobs on some of those rivers.
			EarthInSpaceLowMountains = Spotted what looks to be an observatory complex on a mountaintop. Its dome is closed for now.
			EarthInSpaceLowMountains = Found a group of climbers. They seem to be surveying the rocks. Grade: mostly harmless.
			EarthInSpaceLowMountains = Nothing of interest to national defense, just barren rock, but the fact that we can get to places where even the mountains look small is a testament to the accomplishments of society.
			EarthInSpaceLowSavannah = The nature, the farms, the rolling hills. You can see the plants growing.
			//EarthInSpaceLowHighlands = You can see the highland cities, and the tourism they are built on.
			EarthInSpaceLowForest = Snapped photo of a kerbal with a largish telescope, pointing directly at the satellite. Amateur astronomer, probably. But why is he still looking up after dawn?
			EarthInSpaceLowDesert = The desert looks hostile, but there are flourishing cities and settlements dotted across it, a reminder that anything can be done with enough will, time, and resources. The third, the desert has plenty.
			EarthInSpaceLowDesert = Found some nomads on kamels, resting by an oasis. Not a threat.
			EarthInSpaceLowDesert = Staring at what seems to be a mass of granular silicon dioxide. Are you sure you want to waste surveillance-grade film on this?
			EarthInSpaceLowDesert = Spotted enemy rocket test! Fortunately for us, it failed just under a minute after liftoff.
			EarthInSpaceLowWater = The boats and ships crossing Earth's waters seem mostly benign.
			EarthInSpaceLowWater = You can see the containers on the freighters, kerbals on ferries and the aircraft of a carrier.
			EarthInSpaceLowWater = You spot a lone boat in the middle of the ocean. What is it doing?
			EarthInSpaceLowWater = Snapped high-detail photos of the latest algae bloom. Its spread can be accurately determined from this image.
			EarthInSpaceLowWater = All is calm this time, just a light breeze over the ocean and fish swimming underneath.
			//EarthInSpaceLowBadlands = Photographed some rocks, a tree, and a mining town.
			//EarthInSpaceLowBadlands = Captured images of oil wells among the rocks. May be important later.
			//EarthInSpaceLowBadlands = Spotted an airbase, large. Site marked as 'important'.
			//EarthInSpaceLowBadlands = This particularly treacherous, rocky view shows why this place is called "the Badlands". it really is bad.
			EarthInSpaceLowTundra = You photographed a silo. Probably nuclear ICBM. You've also captured some tracks left behind by lorries servicing the silo.
			EarthInSpaceLowTundra = Trees, a bear, and some snow. Normal tundra stuff.
			EarthInSpaceLowTundra = Just some rocks and a tent.
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = You get a very washed-out, fuzzy image from the bright white ice, so the high resolution image is utterly worthless here.
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = Ice, ice, and more ice. And what's that? A 50-kerb Krussian outpost? Probably harmless. 
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = Big glacier splitting off. Better put on some navigation warnings and inform the KOAA.
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = You see some polar bears and seals. One seems to be eating the other.
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = Captured sub-meter resolution image of... ice. And some flocks of birds. And their kuano. At least you know where the ice is cracking.
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = Spotted the latest polar expedition. They seem to be all fine, but they got their snowcat stuck a few times.
			EarthInSpaceLowIceCaps = Big crack spotted and... ice falling! At least the penguins are safe.
			EarthInSpaceLow = Collected very high-res images. You can discern cars, roads, rivers and even potholes from space!
			EarthInSpaceLow = Earth looks beautiful from up here. But we're not interested in that. we're here for spying - oh, sorry, scratch that - science!
			EarthInSpaceLow = Captured some interesting details on the planet's surface.
			
			MoonInSpaceLow = The gray, cratered surface in this image can make one philosophical about the uniqueness of their existence.
		//MoonInSpaceLow = The darker volcanic plains, the mountains, hills, and valleys all remind you of Earth. You can see why the astronomers of the Proot Era thought the Mun was another world, with people not unlike our own. //@Proot, creator of the KSP Renaissance Compilation
		MoonInSpaceLow = You see some rocks. Or were those rovers? or bases? At this distance, it's hard to tell. But you can tell that they were big. can see anything in them.
		MoonInSpaceLow = Closer to the Moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. But does this image show any evidence of enemy Moon bases?
			    MoonInSpaceLowMidlands = The possibly igneous small flats are peppered by small craters and rocks.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMidlands = Light-colored ejecta from some craters is visible and not dark igneous rock, so we can now absolutely, definitively prove that even the smallest ones are impact craters.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMidlands = There are plenty of rocks here, at least we think those are rocks. At  this distance it's hard to tell if they're natural of artificial, like a rover or something.
			    MoonInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands have a slightly lighter appearance, with the frequency of craters-in-craters suggesting that these may contain some of the oldest rock in the Earth system. Their overall shape is also reminiscent of the hills and mountains of Earth.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMajorCraters = The large craters, seemingly eroded by aeons of meteorite impacts and solar wind, have plenty of evidence to suggest their old age, and by extension the age of the rest of the region.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareFrigoris = The darker volcanic plains, the mountains, hills, and valleys all remind you of Earth.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareNectaris = The darker volcanic plains, the mountains, hills, and valleys all remind you of Earth.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareCrisium = Observations of details in the visual scan may indicate that this basin was formed by lava welling up after a large asteroid impact.
			    MoonInSpaceLowOceanusProcellarum = Observations of details in the visual scan may indicate that this basin was formed by lava welling up after a large asteroid impact.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareOrientale = Observations of details in the visual scan may indicate that this mare was formed by lava welling up after a large asteroid impact.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareSerenitatis = Observations of details in the visual scan may indicate that this mare was formed by lava welling up after a large asteroid impact.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareTranquillitatis = Observations show that this region appears to be quite... tranquil.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareImbrium = Despite its prominence when viewed from the surface of Kerbin, these relatively close-up observations confirm that this is in fact just a crater, nothing special. Early astronomers thought that this was a dried-up lake.
			    MoonInSpaceLowMareFecunditatis = This crater seems eroded, almost like its walls unevenly crumbled after it was formed. Beware of potentially soft rock.
			    MoonInSpaceLowAitkenBasin = Despite never being seen from above is such detail before, it feels quite familiar. Earth looms just over the horizon, sitting there, a reminder of the Moon's tidal lock and the incoming far side, never seen by Kerbal eyes before.
			    MoonInSpaceLowAitkenBasin = This is a large crater, the largest on the Moon. Slight glimmers of light in the shadow of the crater rim may signify a deposit of water ice here! Otherwise, you can see rocks. We're sure none of those glimmers were missions on the Mun, neither ours nor the Krussians. 
			    MoonInSpaceLowNorthPole = The polar regions. Not bright and shiny as Earth's poles, which means that while these are quite boring, our cameras can reveal more detail in them than on Earth's poles. Some of the higher areas receive sunlight year-round, but they shadow the polar lowlands where in some places it is permanently dark. The temperature gradient on the surface would be interesting, but this is an optical device. Not an infrared one.
			    MoonInSpaceLowSouthPole = The permanently shadowed craters may contain water ice, possibly in high enough concentration to be harvested in the future. The Sun is permanently on the horizon, and in the lower parts may have never been seen in the history of the Moon. Great hiding place.
			    
		MarsInSpaceLow = Mars has a vide variety of terrain, ranging from deep chasms, to tall mountain ranges, and plains. Its ice caps are small and slowly disappearing from the poles.
		MarsInSpaceHigh = The pale red dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...
		
		VenusInSpaceLow = Venus greets you with great delight as you swoop past, with how bright and reflective its clouds are. Too bad you can't see very well beyond them with this camera.
		VenusInSpaceHigh = The Morning Star shimmers down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...

	RESULTS
	{
	// Credit to Gregoria Luna (Gregrox) for the results text
	default = You begin a survey of deep-sky-objects in the galactic plane. Many open clusters and nebulae are waiting to be found.
	
	SunInSpaceLow = You observe the sun. This was a spectacularly bad idea.
	SunInSpaceHigh = You observe the sun. Only after you hear the "temperature anomaly" alarm do you remember you forgot to install the solar filter. This is a real certified Icarus moment.

	KerbinInSpaceLow = Above the influence of atmospheric turbulence, the telescope is capable of reaching much more consistently high resolutions at a wide field of view than possible from the ground. Until you get orders from the Kerbal Astronomical Society, you use the time to split a few double stars which you hadn't got yet.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Far from Kerbin, the observatory is capable of observing a vast portion of the sky with little interference. You begin a survey of distant galaxies.
	KerbinSrfLandedDesert = From within Kerbin's atmosphere, the atmospheric turbulence causes the image to boil and shimmer, leading to a lower resolution. Planetary imaging must be done with extreme-short exposures and with digital processing to stack the image.
	KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The observatory is relatively unhindered by low-level fog and some of the effects of atmospheric seeing conditions, allowing a higher resolution than at sea level. Still though, it's not the best place for imaging at high resolution, so you mostly concern yourself with assembling mosaics of larger deep-sky-objects.
	KerbinSrfLandedMountains = This is a good place for a remote observatory. Above the effects of light pollution and atmospheric turbulence, the sky opens up in sharp, high resolution detail--though space would be better. You search for nearby exoplanetary transit events with the SLIPPIST-camera.
	KerbinSrfLandedWater = Sea spray and sand is getting into the instrument. That's going to be a maintenance nightmare. You attempt to do some imaging, but between the fog, the turbulent air, and the sea spray, this observing session's a wash.
	KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Sea spray and sand is getting into the instrument. That's going to be a maintenance nightmare. You attempt to do some imaging, but between the fog, the turbulent air, and the sea spray, this observing session's a wash.
	KerbinSrfLandedWater = Sea spray and sand is getting into the instrument. That's going to be a maintenance nightmare. You attempt to do some imaging, but between the fog, the turbulent air, and the sea spray, this observing session's a wash.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Light pollution here at the KSC makes observing deep-sky-objects very impractical. You really need to get out to the middle of nowhere if you wanna see the night sky. Still though, this is a great place for a public Munwatch, maybe Walt Kerman and his P.R. team have an idea about how to do that.
	KerbinSrfLanded =  From within Kerbin's atmosphere, the atmospheric turbulence causes the image to boil and shimmer, leading to a lower resolution. Planetary imaging must be done with extreme-short exposures and with digital processing to stack the image.


	MunInSpaceLow = If you could just slow down, the instrument would be capable of extreme high resolution surface images. In fact, you'd almost not need to send down astronauts! Who needs astronauts when you have astronomers, after all.
	MunInSpaceHigh = Pointing the observatory down towards the surface would make for a high-resolution mapping satellite, but we only packed astronomical sensors, so you'll have to settle for unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos.
	MunSrfLanded = This is a great place for a close-to-home deep space observatory! The skies really pop, day and night.

	// Minmus_InSpaceLow = 
	Minmus_InSpaceHigh = You attempt a long-exposure photo to try and detect a coma or cometary tail... if there is one, it's being washed out by Minmus' incredibly reflective surface.
	MinmusSrfLanded = You attempt to measure the spectrum of a bright star, looking for any additional absorption lines, searching for hints of an extended exosphere or cometary envelope on Minmus. There seems to be a very faint absorption feature which you can't match to the star's database.

	// MohoInSpaceLow = 
	// MohoInSpaceHigh = 
	MohoSrfLanded = Moho's rotation rate is remarkably slow, so despite the incredibly bright sun during the day, very long uninterrupted exposures are possible. One useful application of this observatory would be to search for Near-Kerbin asteroids.
	EveInSpaceLow = Note to self: throw away red and green filters, they don't work here.
	EveInSpaceHigh = You point the telescope at Gilly. It's quite startling to see details on the smallest moon--it normally looks like a faint dot!
	EveSrfLanded = This is a pretty terrible place for an observatory - the thick clouds are always present!
	// GillyInSpaceLow = 
	// GillyInSpaceHigh = 
	GillySrfLanded = A strange, niche location for an observatory, however one which provides many useful opportunities to observe Eve at high resolution. Infrared sensors are capable of piercing the clouds, and blue, violet, and ultra-violet filters are best suited for observing the clouds and weather patterns themselves.
	// IkeInSpaceLow = 
	// IkeInSpaceHigh = 
	IkeSrfLanded = You hope you remembered to land on the Duna-facing hemisphere so you can observe it at high resolution. Ike's stationary orbit provides an excellent viewing post for looking at roughly half of Duna, and a terrible viewing post for looking at anything else.

	// DunaInSpaceLow = 
	// DunaInSpaceHigh =
	DunaSrfLanded = You set up the telescope to point back towards the Kerbin system. Even at high power, they're small. You feel smaller. Dust in the atmosphere prevents the acquisition of faint detail, but the seeing conditions here are very good, and when Jool is at opposition this telescope can beat similar Kerbin-based instruments in seeing its cloud bands, which no longer appear fuzzy.
	DresInSpaceLow = They said to get out in the middle of nowhere to do deep-sky-viewing. But I don't think they meant it like that!
	DresInSpaceHigh = There seems to be a large amount of star-trails interfering with long-exposure images near Dres' equatorial plane... could there be a debris disk here?
	DresSrfLanded = It's like no-one will ever know you put a telescope here. 

	JoolInSpaceLow = From this vantage point, many of the objects in the Jool system are easily seen. Tylo, Vall, Bop, Pol, and Kerbin... hey wait a minute, that's not how this works!
	JoolInSpaceHigh = What do you know, it turns out Jool isn't always fuzzy through a telescope!
	JoolSrfLanded = This location would make a great observing post for studying the Joolian moons, were it not for the scorching temperatures, the crushing pressures, and the many layers of clouds and haze. 

	// LaytheInSpaceLow = 
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = The images you get off the sensors are full of extra noise for some reason. Who needs a geiger counter when you have horrifying signal to noise ratios!
	LaytheSrfLanded = This is like Kerbin, but no light pollution to speak of, well at least as long as you ignore Jool, which is much brighter than the Mun, and Tylo and Vall, which are almost as bright as the Mun... hey we did remember to park the observatory on the far side away from Jool, right?
	LaytheSrfSplashed = Sea spray and sand are getting into the instrument. That's going to be a maintenance nightmare. You attempt to do some imaging, but between the fog, the turbulent air, and the sea spray, this observing session's a wash.

	// VallInSpaceLow = 
	// VallInSpaceHigh = 
	VallSrfLanded = Aside from the radiation messing up the signal, this would make a great observing post for studying the other worlds of this system.

	// TyloInSpaceLow = 
	// TyloInSpaceHigh = 
	TyloSrfLanded = Aside from the radiation messing up the signal, this would make a great observing post for studying the other worlds of this system.

	// BopInSpaceLow = 
	BopInSpaceHigh = You slew the telescope around to face Bop. For some reason the software won't let you focus in on the surface in one place. It gives a "Danger" message like if you try to point it at the Sun.
	// BopSrfLanded = 
	PolInSpaceLow = From low orbit there seems to be a load of statically charged dust particles clinging to the sensor like pollen. Perhaps Pol isn't the best place to put an observatory, even though it does look down on the entire Jool system.
	// PolInSpaceHigh = 
	PolSrfLanded = Keep the dust off the sensors! We've had enough of this kind of error in the past. At least dust on the mirrors makes little difference aside from reducing the contrast and resolution slightly. It'd probably just damage the mirrors more if we tried to wipe them clean.

	// EelooInSpaceLow = 
	EelooInSpaceHigh = Now THIS is the middle of nowhere! From this perspective, the magnitude of many faint trans-joolean-objects is increased dramatically during opposition, allowing for a better and more accurate categorization of the small icy objects sharing the space beyond Jool.
	EelooSrfLanded = Eeloo is great because it's very easy to cool the imaging sensors to reduce noise. You contemplate plans to shovel the surface material directly onto the sensor to improve cooling.

// 		LaytheInSpace = Belts of trapped radiation around Laythe are recorded.
// 		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Laythe seems to have its own radiation belt in addition to being within Jool's radiation belt.
// 		LaytheInSpaceLow = The amount of radiation due to Laythe's belt of trapped ions and electrons is only compounded by the radiation resulting from being within Jool's radiation belt.
// 		VallInSpace = Vall does not possess any radiation belts, suggesting it has no magnetic field.
// 		VallInSpaceLow = The only trapped radiation here seems to be coming from Jool itself.
// 		VallInSpaceHigh = Vall sits squarely in the middle of Jool's radiation belt is subjected to a constant barrage of charged ions and electrons.
