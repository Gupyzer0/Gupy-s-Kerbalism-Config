// KERBALISM_HDD_SIZES - Temporary tweaking values
// ============================================================================
// Tweaking hints
//
// data - baseline size in Mb (keep in mind it gets 4 big upgrades, don't go overboard)
// samples - sample slots. this one is counter-intuitive, as most experiments
// occupy multiple slots per run. Slot size is tied to data scales in kerbalism's
// back-end, and samples have large data values for lab analysis purposes.
// ============================================================================
// Change values here, they'll get copied and patched later in this file.
// Anything that modifies tech tree positions
// (such as unmanned tech trees, or Probes Before Crew for example)
// will need a patch to balance these values, otherwise they make no sense.
// Patching mods that add a ton of command modules is a nightmare.
// General balancing idea: based on unlock tiers. Probes get on average
// 1.5 - 2 times more data storage due to lack of sample storage.
// Probe numbers based on subtracting the mass attributable to gyros and
// batteries, then multiplying the remaining mass by the cost and a constant
// related to the tech tier. 
//
//
// ============================================================================
// Capacity Upgrades are multipliers for the base value
// ============================================================================
// MAKE SURE NO FIELDS ARE LEFT EMPTY OR COMMENTED OUT IN THIS SECTION,
// OTHERWISE MODULE MANAGER WILL THROW ERRORS
